# ShapesDesignerUsingSwing
In the project you will construct a Java GUI that uses event handlers and listeners while expanding on the project 1 Shape theme.

Assignment Details
Design, implement and test a set of Java classes that allows a user to select a shape from a list of 
available shape images, enter appropriate dimensional parameters (suggest a dropdown box of 
dimensional size choices) and then display that shape in a frame (either as an image or as a drawing). 
Your list of shapes should be similar, if not identical to the ones used in project one:
• Circle
• Square
• Triangle
• Rectangle
• Sphere
• Cube
• Cone
• Cylinder
• Torus
